# SDEV300-Lab5

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script developed as part of my college coursework. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and my ability to analyze and visualize data using pandas and matplotlib. This coursework is part of my Building Secure Python Applications (SDEV 300) class at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To allow users to select a file and column for data analysis.
- To display statistical information about the selected column.
- To visualize the data distribution using histograms.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Data Analysis**: Loading and analyzing data using pandas.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating and displaying histograms using matplotlib.
- **User Interaction**: Developing an interactive command-line interface for data selection and analysis.
- **Python Programming**: Writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Enhance Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, improving my understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Abilities**: Developed solutions for analyzing and visualizing data based on user inputs.
- **Develop User Interfaces**: Learned to design and implement effective command-line interfaces for user interaction.

## Files Included
- `SDEV-Wk5-Lab5.py`: The main Python script that allows users to select a file and column for analysis, display statistics, and plot histograms.
- `PopChange.csv`: The population data file used for analysis.
- `Housing.csv`: The housing data file used for analysis.

## Usage Instructions
To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Logan-Toms/SDEV300-Lab5.git
    cd SDEV300-Lab5
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python SDEV-Wk5-Lab5.py
    ```

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
    - Choose the file you want to analyze (Population Data or Housing Data).
    - Select the column you want to analyze from the provided options.
    - View the statistical information and histogram for the selected column.
    - You can exit the program or return to the main menu to select another file/column.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **pandas**: A library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: A library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
